### HOW TO RUN THE CODE ###

1. Run Project4_ModifiedMNIST_Preprocessing.ipynb.

This will download the raw data hosted online, and create the processed csv files, train_x_processed_2c.csv, and test_x_processed_2c.csv.

2. Now, run the various classifiers as needed. The CNN code has supported imports to be run in Google Colab. However, the first few instructions can be ignored
   if the code is being run locally.
